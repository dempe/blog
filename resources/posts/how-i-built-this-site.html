<h2>Why PHP</h2>

I was tired of using off-the-shelf static site generators (SSGs) like Hugo and Jekyll.  I felt that I had too little control, especially when it came to their templating languages and themes.  An SSG can't be <em>that</em> hard.

First of all, what do SSGs offer?

<li>
    <ul>Markdown (or similar) to HTML conversion</ul>
    <ul>Templating</ul>
    <ul>A server to dynamically display local changes</ul>
    <ul>Layouts to structure your site</ul>
    <ul>Themes</ul>
    <ul>Method to build raw, static site to be deployed</ul>
</li>

One day it occurred to me that PHP can accomplish most of this. PHP has been the de-facto HTML templating language since the 90s. It handles layouts easily -- just nest your PHP files within other PHP files. It can handle Markdown conversion via <a href="https://parsedown.org/">3rd party libraries</a> and has a built-in web server (<code>php -S addr:port</code>).

The only things PHP doesn't have are themes (I want to use my own CSS anyway) and a build command<sup><a href="#footnote1">footnote</a></sup>.  Building's not a problem, either.  I can use a simple <code>wget</code> incantation to pull down a static version of my site from the local server (see the section, <a href="#building-and-deployment">"Building and Deployment"</a>).

So PHP it is.

<h2>Site Structure</h2>

- KISS
- no JS
- index == posts
- drafts handled via separate branch (makes commit msgs easier, too)
- about page
- tags list
- page for each tag dynamically generated

<h2>Relational Database</h2>

- posts, slug for key
- tags, name for key
- posttags table for normalization
- insanely easier
- eloquent + eager loading
- how i create a new post
- seeding, migrations

<h2 id="building-and-deployment">Building and Deployment</h2>

- wget
- output dir
- cloudflare

<h2>Conventions, Style, etc.</h2>

- primary purpose of site is to "consume info"
- colors, minimize contrast
- off-white on off-black to reduce eye strain
- bold fonts
- text on one side to reduce eye movement on large screens
- responsive design
- writing style

<h2>To-Do</h2>

- syntax highlighting
- 404
- artisan cleanup
- markdown conversion

<h2>Why PHP</h2>

- tired of off-the-shelf SSGs
- PHP is the ultimate HTML templating lang
- no problem writing in HTML with modern editors + more control

<h2>Site Structure</h2>

- KISS
- no JS
- index == posts
- drafts handled via separate branch (makes commit msgs easier, too)
- about page
- tags list
- page for each tag dynamically generated

<h2>Relational Database</h2>

- posts, slug for key
- tags, name for key
- posttags table for normalization
- insanely easier
- eloquent + eager loading
- how i create a new post
- seeding, migrations

<h2>Building and Deployment</h2>

- wget
- output dir
- cloudflare

<h2>Conventions, Style, etc.</h2>

- primary purpose of site is to "consume info"
- colors, minimize contrast
- off-white on off-black to reduce eye strain
- bold fonts
- text on one side to reduce eye movement on large screens
- responsive design
- writing style

<h2>To-Do</h2>

- syntax highlighting
- 404
- artisan cleanup

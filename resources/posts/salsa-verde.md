- In the meantime, cut up the chillis into relatively large slices.
- The tomatoes are finished when they have burnt spots and the onions are translucent. Take them out and add them to a blender.
- Cook the chillis until they have burnt spots.

- When the chillis are done, add them to the blender with the tomatoes, onions, and garlic. Blend.
- Add the avocado, cream cheese, cream, and cilantro.  Blend.
- After blending, pour the salsa back into the pan and heat it for a couple of minutes on low heat.

A *carlota* or *carlota de lim√≥n* is a type of "bread pudding" (similar to a [Charlotte Cake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_(cake))).  It's a common dessert in Mexico, containing, like so many Mexican dishes, limes.

It takes about 10 - 20 minutes to make, a couple of hours to chill.

## Ingredients

- 2 cans condensed milk
- Between 3 - 6 limes depending on size
- Canned peaches
- Vanilla wafers

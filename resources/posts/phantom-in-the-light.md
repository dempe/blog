For much of human history, the rainbow was a supernatural phenomenon. In Judaic religions, it was a sign of God's covenant that he would never kill everyone on earth via a giant flood again.[^1] In Norse mythology, there was the Bifröst, the rainbow bridge that connected Midgard (the realm of man) to Asgard (the realm of the gods). Iris, in Greek mythology, was the goddess of the rainbow and divine messenger of the gods. For much of human history, the rainbow was as inscrutable as it was inconstructible.[^2][^3]

## Isaac Newton

In 1672, Newton used a prism to divide white light. With this simple experiment, the prevailing Aristotelian dogma of the last 2000 years regarding light was overturned literally in a flash. Until white light came under the scrutiny of Newton's genius, it was thought that white light was pure, and that it obtained color through interaction with darkness and matter. Newton showed that it was the other way about. Instead, white light is a combination of all other colors. Newton nailed the coffin shut on Aristotle's theory of light when he recombined a rainbow back into white light, showing once and for all that white light is indeed a combination.

Newton published the results of his experiments in his book[^4] _Opticks_ in 1704. [^5] In _Opticks_, he coins the term, "spectrum" (from Latin for "image" or "apparition"), to describe the range of refracted light, which is where we get the modern term, "electromagnetic spectrum."

Due to the crudeness of 1670s equipment, Newton did not notice that his spectrum was not actually continuous. There were tiny gaps in his refracted light. These gaps would go unnoticed for another 130 years. But what exactly were these gaps?

## Fraunhofer Lines

The gaps in the sun's spectrum were finally noticed in 1802 by an Englishman, William Hyde Wollaston. Wollaston had invented a much-improved spectroscope using lenses that allowed him to view the same spectrum as Newton but in much greater fidelity. But Wollaston didn't know what the gaps were. He assumed they were the "gaps between colors" and left it at that.

Ten years later, the German physicist Joseph von Fraunhofer invented yet another improved spectroscope. Fraunhofer's spectroscope used a diffraction grating in place of a prism. A diffraction grating is just thousands of slits placed very close together. This permits two key things over prism-based refraction:

- The spectral resolution is even higher than with Wollaston's prism/lense combo.
- A diffraction grating allows the wavelengths of diffracted light to be *measured*.

    text="The speed of light is constant in a *vacuum*. However, through all other media (air, water, glass, etc.) light gradually slows down based on the medium's *refractive index*. [^6] So light can and does change speed when going from one medium to another. Moreover, it's precisely this change in speed that produces rainbows."/>

<x-sho
    text="How does a change in speed produce rainbows?"/>

<x-shin
    text="Via a phenomenon called *dispersion*. A medium's refractive index actually varies based on *wavelength*. Shorter wavelengths (e.g., blue light) are slowed more than longer wavelengths (e.g., red light). [^7] The degree to which light bends (i.e., refracts) [^8] is based on its speed which is based on its refractive index which is based on its wavelength."/>

Fraunhofer had never heard of Wollaston's discovery of the gaps in refracted solar light.  But in 1814, he incidentally made the same observations. However, unlike Wollaston, Fraunhofer, with his new spectrometer, had the means to actually _quantify_ these gaps. So he set out on a systematic analysis of the gaps in the solar spectrum. He identified 570 distinct lines giving each a unique label. [^9] These gaps are now called "Fraunhofer lines" in his honor, but commonly referred to as "spectral lines."

<x-sho text="Fraunhofer's spectro<em>scope</em> was really the first spectro<em>meter</em>. Though &quot;spectroscope&quot; and &quot;spectrometer&quot; are often used interchangeably, <em>meter</em> in Latin implies measurement, which is exactly what Fraunhofer's spectrometer allowed for!" />

With Fraunhofer's spectral measurements, the field of quantitative spectroscopy was born.

Helium was the first element whose extraterrestrial discovery preceded its terrestrial discovery.

## Footnotes

[^1]: Though he said nothing about killing everyone on earth via other means!

[^2]: The Romans were aware of the fact that rainbows could be constructed via prisms. But they neglected to ask how or why. As they were sometimes wont to do. See [footnote 3](#fn:3).

[^3]: The Romans were in some ways antithetical to the Greeks. The Greeks eschewed experimentation for theory, while the Romans eschewed theory for experimentation. Experimentation requires manual labor, and the Greeks, a slave-based society, equated this with slave labor. The Romans, on the other hand, were engineers and concerned with practical, rather than theoretical matters. Think roads, aqueducts, architecture, and military. The marriage of theory and experiment, via the scientific method, would have to wait until 1620 when Francis Bacon published his treatise, _Novum Organum_ ("The New Instrument").

[^4]: _Opticks_ was actually 3 books with a planned-but-never-written fourth book.

[^5]: Observant readers will note that Newton published _Opticks_ over 30 years after his experiments. Why did he wait so long to publish? In short, because Robert Hooke had just died the year prior. Newton presented his findings to London's Royal Society scientists as he made them. Robert Hooke, another prominent member of the Royal Society, took issue with Newton's proposed corpuscular theory of light. Newton didn't care for fame and cared even less for fighting. Instead of publishing and risking a public debate with Hooke, he waited until Hooke was out of the picture.

[^6]: \(v = \frac{c}{n}), where \(v\) is the speed of light in the medium, \(c\) is the speed of light in a vacuum, and \(n\) is the refractive index of the material.

[^7]: This is because light (or any electromagnetic radiation) with a short wavelength will interact more with intervening particles than radiation with a longer wavelength.

[^8]: The degree of bending is governed by Snell's Law:  \( n_1 \sin(\theta_1) = n_2 \sin(\theta_2) \), where \( n_1 \) and \( n_2 \) are the refractive indices of the two media, and \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.

[^9]: Modern equipment can detect thousands of Fraunhofer lines in sunlight!

        Hello! I'm Chris Dempewolf (dim-pee-wolf), software engineer, former ESL teacher, and, most recently, father.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm from <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Smith,_Arkansas">Fort Smith</a>, Arkansas. I lived in Seattle for 2 years and abroad in Mexico ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½, Japan ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ, and Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª. I taught English for a couple of years and have worked as a software engineer for 7 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made this blog to explore my thoughts. I don't really know what I know until I write it, so this is meant to serve as my light in the dark.

    <p>This blog's title, <em>Shosin</em>, is a Zen concept roughly translated as "beginner's mind", a concept first popularized in the West by Zen teacher <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunry%C5%AB_Suzuki">Shunryu Suzuki</a> in his book, <em><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_Mind,_Beginner's_Mind">Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind</a></em>. It implies curiosity, openness, and approaching things without preconceptions.  It is the goal of this blog to explore many new and interesting topicsâ€”always through the eyes of a beginner.</p>

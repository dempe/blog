                Hello! I'm Chris Dempewolf (dim-pee-wolf), software engineer, former ESL teacher, and, most recently,
                husband and father.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm from <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Smith,_Arkansas">Fort Smith</a>,
                Arkansas. I lived in Seattle for 2 years and abroad in Mexico ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½, Japan ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ, and Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª. I taught
                English for a couple of years and have worked as a software engineer for 7 years.
            </p>
            <p>
                I made this blog to explore my thoughts and practice my writing. I don't really know what I know until I
                write it, so this blog is meant to serve as my light in the dark.

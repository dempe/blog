    <p>This blog's title, <em>Shosin</em>, is a Zen concept roughly translated as "beginner's mind", a concept first popularized in the West by Zen teacher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunry%C5%AB_Suzuki">Shunryu Suzuki</a> in his book, <em><a href="">Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind</a></em>. It implies curiosity, openness, and approaching things without preconceptions.  It is the goal of this blog to explore many new and interesting topics—always through the eyes of a beginner.</p>
